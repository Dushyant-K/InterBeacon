# InterBeacon

### Introduction 
What actually happens, in inter-college sporting events is that many colleges and universities of different cities come together. That's why it becomes so difficult for the organizers and the hosting college to keep a track record of all the events and the participants performing in it. To solve these types of problems, we created a platform that can be used to overcome all these situations by not only creating a database but also changing it dynamically as per the requirements.  
This software system will be a Web Management System as well as an application management system in which the data of participants and events taking place is managed by us. This system will be designed to maximize the organizer's efficiency in updating any kind of information related to any event as well as keeping in mind the participant's convenience to view his schedule at our website or through our application. We also provide tools in assisting the organizer with the event review. By maximizing the organizer's work efficiency the system will meet the editorâ€™s needs while remaining easy to understand and use.
Fascinating?? Let's have a closure look at what we have to offer.


### Brief Description
In Inter-College Sporting Events, many colleges and universities of different cities come together. Due to a large number of students at the venue, it becomes difficult for organizers and host colleges to keep harmony with all the participants and respective events. Hence there was an immediate need for one platform which can be used to overcome all these problems.
InterBeacon does the required job. As it connects all the students, organizers, and the respective authorities, it makes it easier for notifying, also participants know about the schedules of the games and many such issues. Also, there are alternate ways like Gmail, making WhatsApp groups, and calling but this app brings everything to one place and simplifies the process. Also, transparency in scores and results can be maintained as everything is maintained in one place.
InterBeacon is specifically made for college events and solves related problems.
